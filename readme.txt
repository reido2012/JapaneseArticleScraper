Japanese Google News Article Scraper

What is it?
Python code that gets Google news articles from Japan.
(If you're not blocked by Google)

Features -
Gets the title, content and link for articles on google news and returns all of
the articles as a JSON file.
(I was going to search multiple URLs but I couldn't test it as my IP
address got blocked I have left the commented code in)

How to run -
Make sure you have python installed. (I wrote this using python 3)

then run command "python3 news.py" or "python news.py".

You may also need to install BeautifulSoup4, you can get that with the command
"pip install beautifulsoup4".

This will then start to getting data from news articles.
